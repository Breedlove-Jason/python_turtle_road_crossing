# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a simple yet engaging game created using Python's Turtle graphics module. The objective of the game is to guide
the turtle through the traffic lanes and reach the other side of the screen without colliding with any of the cars. Each
time the turtle successfully crosses the screen, the difficulty increases with faster cars and more traffic.
